# Changelog

Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Only project-wide changes are mentioned here. For individual function changelogs, please refer to their
respective Git histories.

Locutus does not follow SemVer as we're a work in progress - and even though we try, 
we cannot guarantee BC-safety for the hundreds of contributions across the many 
languages that Locutus is assimilating.

Instead, we recommend using version pinning, and inspect changes for the few particular functions you rely on
when you upgrade.

## Backlog

Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point

- [ ] Address the 25 remaining test failures that are currently skipped (find out which ones via `npm run test:languages:noskip`)
- [ ] Compare example test cases for PHP against `php -r` to make sure they are correctly mimicking the most recent stable behavior
- [ ] Have _one_ way of checking pure JS arrays vs PHP arrays (vs: `Object.prototype.toString.call(arr1) === '[object Array]'`, `typeof retObj[p] === 'object'`, `var asString = Object.prototype.toString.call(mixedVar) var asFunc = _getFuncName(mixedVar.constructor) if (asString === '[object Object]' && asFunc === 'Object') {` )
- [ ] Investigate if we can have one helper function for intersecting, and use that in all `array_*diff*` and `array_*sort*` functions. Refrain from using `labels`, which those functions currently still rely on
- [ ] Investigate if we can have one helper function for sorting, and use that in all `*sort*` functions
- [ ] Investigate if we can have one helper function to resolve `Function/'function'/'Class::function'/[$object, 'function']`, and use that in `is_callable`, `array_walk`, `call_user_func_array` etc.
- [ ] Parse `require`s with AST just like Browserify does. Then we can add dependencies back to website
- [ ] Port a few more tricky/inter-depending Go functions
- [ ] Port a few more tricky/inter-depending Python functions
- [ ] Port a few more tricky/inter-depending Ruby functions
- [ ] website: Render authors server-side
- [ ] website: Fix the search functionality
