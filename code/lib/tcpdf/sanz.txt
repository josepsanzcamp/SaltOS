I have replaced TCPDF by WarnockPDF because TCPDF project is obsolete:
- https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF
- https://github.com/code-lts/WarnockPDF

I removed for security reasons the follow directories:
- tests
- tools
- scripts
- examples

Fixed some php8.1 errors:
- on line 6310 of WarnockPDF.php, I have commented the array_walk($chrw, array($this, 'getRawCharWidth')) because it is not necessary, seems to be an error because the objective is achieved by the line 3909.
